*A blazingly fast test/code editor written in **rust** and built on top of [egui](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/) that works out of the box.*

# Installation

Rode is shipped across multiple platforms, mainly *Github Releases* and [crates.io](https://crates.io). Note that nightly builds are an ongoing process and are planned to arrive in the near future.

## Compiling from Source

If you would like to compile from source, please follow the instructions below.

> **Prerequisites** - Ensure you have the `cargo` package manager installed since this project requires Rust and a few of its published crates

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/kashsuks/rode
```

2. Change directory
```
cd rode
```

3. Run the startup command:
```
cargo run
```
You will see that the required packages will get installed and the application may (or may not) run depending on whether the current commit is stable. This will be discussed in the following note.

>[!NOTE]
> The Github commits are not guaranteed to be stable since they are meant to be developer logs (**not user friendly versions**).
> Do not expect them to work because I am a solo developer and I have too much shit to deal with.
> The same applies to nightly builds (when they do arrive).
> They will not be stable. Do not expect them to be stable.

## Mac Installation

- For Mac Silicon (any of the M series chips), please use `rode-editor-apple-silicon`

Once you've installed it:
- Copy the path of the install (either through finder or whatever method)
- Go to your terminal of choice and type in `chmod +x <the path to the install>`
- Then run `rode-editor-apple-silicon`

If apple says that the install cannot be verified:
- Go to settings
- Scroll down to `Privacy & Security`
- Scroll all the way down and in the `Security` section it should ask for permission to open
- Press allow and give any other permission
- The app _should_ open!

If you would like to use [crates.io](https://crates.io) to use the application please refer to the [published version](https://crates.io/crates/rode-editor)
