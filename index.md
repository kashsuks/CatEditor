## Installation 

Rode does not have an official release on [crates.io](https://crates.io) meaning that any users that would like to use Rode would need to use `cargo` in order to run the application.

The project is hosted on Github and uses Git in order to track changes along the codebase and manage issues publicly.

This means that any developer that wants to develop (or any user that wants to use Rode) would need to install it via Github.

### Steps

*Stable release versions via [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rode-editor)*

*Clone or install via Github*:
- `git clone https://github.com/kashsuks/Rode`
- `cd rode`
- `cargo run`

The project should be installed at `path/Rode`

## Setup

Setup is pretty easy for a development version.

> Make sure that you are using the Github version rather than the [crates.io](https://crates.io) version this has the source code for the project.
