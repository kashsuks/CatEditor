- **Optional Vim mode** with Normal, Insert, Visual, and Visual Line modes

## Quick Start

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
iced = "0.14"
iced-code-editor = "0.4"
```

### Basic Example

Here's a minimal example to integrate the code editor into your Iced application:

> **Note:** `CodeEditor` does not automatically lose focus when another widget is clicked.
> You must call `editor.lose_focus()` whenever another interactive widget is activated.
> The pattern below uses `mouse_area` to detect clicks on sibling widgets.

```rust
use iced::widget::{column, container, mouse_area, text_input};
use iced::{Element, Task};
use iced_code_editor::{CodeEditor, Message as EditorMessage};

struct MyApp {
    editor: CodeEditor,
    input_value: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
enum Message {
    EditorEvent(EditorMessage),
    InputChanged(String),
    InputClicked,
}

impl Default for MyApp {
    fn default() -> Self {
        let code = r#"fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
"#;

        Self {
            editor: CodeEditor::new(code, "rust"),
            input_value: String::new(),
        }
    }
}

impl MyApp {
    fn update(&mut self, message: Message) -> Task<Message> {
        match message {
            Message::EditorEvent(event) => {
                self.editor.update(&event).map(Message::EditorEvent)
            }
            Message::InputChanged(value) => {
                self.input_value = value;
                self.editor.lose_focus(); // required: transfer focus away from editor
                Task::none()
            }
            Message::InputClicked => {
                self.editor.lose_focus(); // required: transfer focus away from editor
                Task::none()
            }
        }
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Element<'_, Message> {
        let input = mouse_area(
            text_input("Type something...", &self.input_value)
                .on_input(Message::InputChanged)
                .padding(8),
        )
        .on_press(Message::InputClicked); // detect click to trigger lose_focus

        container(
            column![input, self.editor.view().map(Message::EditorEvent)]
                .spacing(10)
                .height(iced::Fill),
        )
        .padding(20)
        .into()
    }
}

fn main() -> iced::Result {
    iced::run(MyApp::update, MyApp::view)
}
```

## Vim Mode

Vim behavior is disabled by default and configured independently for each
`CodeEditor` instance. Enabling it enters Normal mode and collapses any
multi-cursor state to the primary cursor:

```rust
use iced_code_editor::{CodeEditor, VimMode};

let mut editor =
    CodeEditor::new("fn main() {}", "rs").with_vim_enabled(true);
assert!(editor.vim_enabled());
assert_eq!(editor.vim_mode(), Some(VimMode::Normal));

editor.set_vim_enabled(false);
assert_eq!(editor.vim_mode(), None);
```

With the editor focused, press `Ctrl+Alt+V` (or `Command+Alt+V` on macOS)
to switch between Vim and standard editing. Enabling Vim always starts in
Normal mode. The regular `Ctrl`/`Command+V` system-paste shortcut is unchanged.

The MVP supports these keys:

| Context | Keys | Behavior |
| ------- | ---- | -------- |
| Normal/Visual motion | `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` | Move left, down, up, or right |
| Normal/Visual motion | `w`, `b`, `e` | Move to the next word, previous word, or word end |
| Normal/Visual motion | `0`, `^`, `$` | Move to line start, first non-blank, or line end |
| Normal/Visual motion | `gg`, `G` | Move to document start or end when no count is given |
| Normal/Visual motion | `[count]gg`, `[count]G` | Jump to the 1-based logical line, e.g. `5G` or `5gg` jumps to line 5 |
| Enter Insert | `i`, `a`, `I`, `A` | Insert before/after the cursor, at first non-blank, or at line end |
| Enter Insert | `o`, `O` | Open line(s) below or above |
| Select | `v`, `V` | Enter character-wise Visual or Visual Line mode |
| Operators | `d{motion}`, `c{motion}`, `y{motion}` | Delete, change, or yank through any supported motion |
| Line operators | `[count]dd`, `[count]cc`, `[count]yy` | Delete, change, or yank consecutive lines, e.g. `5yy` yanks five lines |
| Visual operators | `d`, `c`, `y` | Apply the operator to the Visual selection |
| Direct edits | `x`, `p`, `P` | Delete characters; paste after or before from the unnamed register |
| History | `u`, `Ctrl+R` | Undo or redo |
| Search | `/pattern`, then `Enter` | Search forward from the cursor and wrap at the end |
| Search repeat | `n`, `N` | Repeat the last search forward or backward |
| Go to line | `:N`, then `Enter` | Jump to 1-based logical line `N`, clamped to the document |
| Save | `:w`, then `Enter` | Request that the host save the current document |
| Exit Vim mode | `:q`, then `Enter` | Disable Vim behavior for the current editor |
| Save and exit Vim mode | `:wq`, then `Enter` | Request a save and disable Vim behavior |
| Command line | `Backspace`, `Escape` | Edit or cancel the active `/` or `:` input |
| Mode exit | `Escape` | Return to Normal mode and clear pending prefixes/selections |
| Count prefix | `1`–`9`, then `0` | Repeat motions, line operators, `x`, paste, undo, or opened lines; operator and motion counts multiply |

When Vim mode is enabled, a fixed status line below the editor shows the
current mode. While entering `/pattern` or `:N`, it shows the command and
current input; otherwise it shows pending Normal-mode keys such as `5d` or
`3g`. The status line remains visible while the document scrolls.

`j` and `k` move by visible display lines, so they follow wrapped lines and
skip folded content. Vim mode is intentionally single-cursor; attempts to add
extra cursors are ignored while it is enabled.

Vim `d`, `c`, `y`, `x`, `p`, and `P` use an unnamed register stored inside
that editor instance. It distinguishes character-wise and line-wise content
and does not access the system clipboard. Platform `Ctrl`/`Command` clipboard
shortcuts (`C`, `X`, and `V`) keep their existing system-clipboard behavior
and take priority over Vim parsing.

Because the editor does not own a file path or perform disk I/O, `:w`, `:wq`,
and `Ctrl`/`Command+S` emit `Message::WriteRequested`. Hosts should intercept
that message and save the corresponding document. The demo app binds all
three inputs to its existing Save/Save As flow.

This is a focused MVP, not full Vim compatibility. Apart from the supported
`:N` line jump and `:q`/`:w`/`:wq` commands, it does not implement Ex
commands. It also does not implement regex search, search history, text
objects, macros, named registers, marks, `.` repeat, or configurable key
mappings.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The editor supports a comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts:

### Navigation

| Shortcut                               | Action                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Arrow Keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) | Move cursor                   |
| **Shift + Arrows**                     | Move cursor with selection    |
| **Home** / **End**                     | Jump to start/end of line     |
| **Shift + Home** / **Shift + End**     | Select to start/end of line   |
| **Ctrl + Home** / **Ctrl + End**       | Jump to start/end of document |
| **Page Up** / **Page Down**            | Scroll one page up/down       |

### Editing

| Shortcut           | Action                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Backspace**      | Delete character before cursor (or delete selection if text is selected) |
| **Delete**         | Delete character after cursor (or delete selection if text is selected)  |
| **Shift + Delete** | Delete selected text (same as Delete when selection exists)              |
| **Enter**          | Insert new line                                                          |
| **Tab**            | Insert indent                                                            |
| **Alt + Up/Down**  | Move current line (or selected lines) up/down                            |
| **Shift + Alt + Up/Down** | Duplicate current line (or selected lines) above/below            |
| **Ctrl + /**       | Toggle line comment on current line (or selected lines)                  |

### Clipboard

| Shortcut                           | Action               |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Ctrl + C** or **Ctrl + Insert**  | Copy selected text   |
| **Ctrl + V** or **Shift + Insert** | Paste from clipboard |

### Undo/Redo

| Shortcut     | Action                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Ctrl + Z** | Undo last operation        |
| **Ctrl + Y** | Redo last undone operation |

The editor features smart command grouping - consecutive typing is grouped into single undo operations, while navigation or deletion actions create separate undo points.

### Multiple Cursors

| Shortcut              | Action                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Alt + Click**       | Add a cursor at the clicked position             |
| **Ctrl + Alt + Up**   | Add a cursor on the line above                   |
| **Ctrl + Alt + Down** | Add a cursor on the line below                   |
| **Ctrl + D**          | Select the next occurrence of the current word/selection |
| **Escape**            | Collapse all cursors back to one (when search dialog is closed) |

All editing operations (typing, backspace, delete, enter, tab, paste) apply simultaneously to every cursor. Copy with multiple selections joins all selected texts with newlines. Paste with the same number of clipboard lines as cursors pastes one line per cursor.

### Search and Replace

| Shortcut          | Action                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Ctrl + F**      | Open search dialog             |
| **Ctrl + H**      | Open search and replace dialog |
| **F3**            | Find next match                |
| **Shift + F3**    | Find previous match            |
| **Escape**        | Close search dialog            |

### Command Palette

| Shortcut                 | Action                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Ctrl + Shift + P**     | Open the command palette                   |
| **Up / Down**            | Move through the filtered commands         |
| **Enter**                | Run the highlighted command                |
| **Escape**               | Close the palette                          |

Typing filters the list by subsequence, so `tc` finds "Toggle Line Comment" and `fldall` finds "Fold All". Only commands that are usable right now are listed — undo does not appear with an empty history, and the folding commands stay out while folding is disabled. Each row shows the command's own keyboard shortcut, so the palette doubles as a way to learn them.

See [Extend the command palette](#extend-the-command-palette) to register the host application's own commands, hide the built-in ones, or turn the palette off entirely.

### Code Folding

These shortcuts are active only when code folding is enabled:

| Shortcut     | Action                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Ctrl + .** | Toggle fold of the block at the cursor          |
| **Ctrl + K** | Fold all blocks                                 |
| **Ctrl + J** | Unfold all blocks                               |

You can also click the fold chevrons (▼ / ▶) in the gutter to collapse or expand a block.

### LSP Completion

These shortcuts are active only when the LSP completion menu is visible:

| Shortcut                          | Action                              |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Arrow Up**                      | Navigate to previous completion item |
| **Arrow Down**                    | Navigate to next completion item    |
| **Enter**                         | Confirm and apply selected completion |
| **Escape**                        | Close completion menu               |
| **Arrow Left** / **Arrow Right**  | Clear completion menu               |

## Usage Examples

### Custom context menu

Custom context-menu actions are identified by stable strings chosen by your
application. Custom entries appear before the built-in editing actions:

```rust
use iced_code_editor::{CodeEditor, ContextMenuEntry};

let editor = CodeEditor::new("fn main() {}", "rust")
    .with_custom_context_menu_entries(vec![
        ContextMenuEntry::item(
            "app.format_document",
            "Format document",
        )
        .with_shortcut("Ctrl+Shift+F"),
        ContextMenuEntry::separator(),
        ContextMenuEntry::item("app.rename_symbol", "Rename symbol")
            .with_enabled(false),
    ])
    .with_default_context_menu_enabled(true);
```

The editor automatically adds a separator between the custom and built-in
groups. Pass `false` to `with_default_context_menu_enabled` to replace the
built-in menu completely. At runtime, use
`set_custom_context_menu_entries` and
`set_default_context_menu_enabled` to update the same configuration.

Handle custom actions in the outer application before forwarding other editor
messages to `CodeEditor::update`:

```rust
match event {
    EditorMessage::CustomContextMenuAction(id) => {
        match id.as_str() {
            "app.format_document" => format_document(),
            "app.rename_symbol" => rename_symbol(),
            unknown => {
                eprintln!(
                    "Ignoring unknown context-menu action: {unknown}"
                );
            }
        }
        Task::none()
    }
    other => editor.update(&other).map(Message::EditorEvent),
}
```

Unknown IDs should be ignored or logged explicitly. The editor emits custom
action IDs unchanged and does not interpret or execute them internally.

The built-in labels follow the language configured with `set_language`.
Custom-entry labels are supplied by the host application, so localize those
strings before passing them to the editor.

Applications with a real filesystem path can opt into the built-in reveal
request:

```rust
editor.set_reveal_in_file_manager_enabled(file_path.is_some());

match event {
    EditorMessage::RevealInFileManager => {
        reveal_file(file_path.as_deref());
        Task::none()
    }
    other => editor.update(&other).map(Message::EditorEvent),
}
```

The menu label is platform-specific: **Reveal in Finder** on macOS,
**Reveal in File Explorer** on Windows, and **Open Containing Folder** on
other desktop platforms. The editor only emits the request; the host is
responsible for invoking the operating system and reporting failures. The demo
enables this item for tabs backed by a desktop path and keeps it hidden for
untitled tabs and WebAssembly.

### Extend the command palette

The palette lists the built-in editor commands out of the box. Register your
application's own commands to have them listed first:

```rust
use iced_code_editor::{CodeEditor, ContextMenuItem};

let editor = CodeEditor::new("fn main() {}", "rust")
    .with_custom_command_palette_entries(vec![
        ContextMenuItem::new("app.open_file", "Open File")
            .with_shortcut("Ctrl+O"),
        ContextMenuItem::new("app.new_tab", "New Tab"),
    ]);
```

Entries reuse `ContextMenuItem`, so an action offered in both surfaces is
described once and keeps a single identifier. An entry built with
`with_enabled(false)` is left out of the palette entirely rather than dimmed:
the palette is a search result list, so every row it offers is runnable.

Running a custom entry emits `CommandPaletteAction` carrying its ID. Handle it
in the outer application, exactly like a custom context-menu action:

```rust
match event {
    EditorMessage::CustomContextMenuAction(id)
    | EditorMessage::CommandPaletteAction(id) => {
        match id.as_str() {
            "app.open_file" => open_file(),
            "app.new_tab" => new_tab(),
            unknown => eprintln!("Ignoring unknown action: {unknown}"),
        }
        Task::none()
    }
    other => editor.update(&other).map(Message::EditorEvent),
}
```

Built-in commands the editor cannot perform on its own — saving, revealing the
file in the file manager — are emitted the same way they would be if the user
had pressed the shortcut, so the host intercepts them where it already does.

Pass `false` to `with_default_command_palette_enabled` to list only your own
commands, and use `set_command_palette_enabled(false)` to disable the palette
altogether, freeing `Ctrl+Shift+P` for an application-provided one:

```rust
let editor = CodeEditor::new("fn main() {}", "rust")
    .with_default_command_palette_enabled(false)
    .with_command_palette_enabled(true);

// Or open it from your own menu item:
let task = editor.open_command_palette();
```

The built-in labels follow the language configured with `set_language`;
localize your own entry labels before passing them in.

### Changing Themes

The editor uses **TokyoNightStorm** as the default theme. It automatically adapts to any Iced theme. All 23+ built-in Iced themes are supported:

```rust
use iced_code_editor::theme;

// Apply any built-in Iced theme
editor.set_theme(theme::from_iced_theme(&iced::Theme::TokyoNightStorm));
editor.set_theme(theme::from_iced_theme(&iced::Theme::Dracula));
editor.set_theme(theme::from_iced_theme(&iced::Theme::Nord));
editor.set_theme(theme::from_iced_theme(&iced::Theme::CatppuccinMocha));
editor.set_theme(theme::from_iced_theme(&iced::Theme::GruvboxDark));

// Or use any theme from Theme::ALL
for theme in iced::Theme::ALL {
    editor.set_theme(theme::from_iced_theme(theme));
}
```

### Getting and Setting Content

```rust
// Get current content
let content = editor.content();

// Check if content has been modified
if editor.is_modified() {
    println!("Editor has unsaved changes");
}

// Mark content as saved (e.g., after saving to file)
editor.mark_saved();
```

### Enable/disable search/replace

The search/replace functionality is **enabled by default**. It can be toggled on or off. When disabled, search shortcuts (Ctrl+F, Ctrl+H, F3) are ignored and the search dialog is hidden:

```rust
// Disable search/replace functionality
editor.set_search_replace_enabled(false);

// Or use builder pattern during initialization
let editor = CodeEditor::new("code", "rs")
    .with_search_replace_enabled(false);

// Check current state
if editor.search_replace_enabled() {
    println!("Search and replace is available");
}
```

This is useful for read-only editors or when you want to provide your own search interface.

### Open search/replace from your own buttons

Besides keyboard shortcuts, you can open or close the dialogs via API:

```rust
// Open search dialog (same as Ctrl+F)
let task = editor.open_search_dialog();

// Open search+replace dialog (same as Ctrl+H)
let task = editor.open_search_replace_dialog();

// Close dialog (same as Esc)
let task = editor.close_search_dialog();
```

Return these tasks from your app `update` function after mapping to your message type.

### Enable/disable line wrapping

Line wrapping is **enabled by default** at viewport width. Long lines can be wrapped automatically at the viewport width or at a fixed column:

```rust
// Enable line wrapping at viewport width
editor.set_wrap_enabled(true);

// Wrap at a fixed column (e.g., 80 characters)
let editor = CodeEditor::new("code", "rs")
    .with_wrap_enabled(true)
    .with_wrap_column(Some(80));

// Disable wrapping
editor.set_wrap_enabled(false);

// Check current state
if editor.wrap_enabled() {
    println!("Line wrapping is active");
}
```

When enabled, wrapped lines show a continuation indicator (↪) in the line number gutter.

### Enable/disable code folding

Code folding is **enabled by default**. Foldable regions are detected from indentation: a line is a fold header when the following non-blank line is more deeply indented (language-agnostic, works for Rust, Python, YAML, etc.). When enabled, a fold margin with clickable chevrons (▼ expanded, ▶ collapsed) is shown in the gutter, and a `⋯` marker appears after a collapsed block header.

```rust
// Disable code folding (chevrons hidden, all lines shown)
editor.set_folding_enabled(false);

// Or use builder pattern during initialization
let editor = CodeEditor::new("code", "rs")
    .with_folding_enabled(false);

// Check current state
if editor.folding_enabled() {
    println!("Code folding is active");
}
```

Folds can also be driven programmatically (useful for your own buttons or commands):

```rust
// Toggle the fold of the block whose header is a given logical line
editor.toggle_fold(0);

// Toggle / fold / unfold the innermost block containing a line
editor.toggle_fold_at(line);
editor.fold_at(line);
editor.unfold_at(line);

// Fold or unfold every block at once
editor.fold_all();
editor.unfold_all();

// Query whether a header line is collapsed
if editor.is_folded(0) {
    println!("Block at line 0 is collapsed");
}
```

When folding is disabled, the collapsed state is preserved (so re-enabling restores the previously collapsed blocks) but no lines are hidden.

### Enable/disable line numbers

Line numbers are **displayed by default**. They can be hidden to maximize space for code:

```rust
// Hide line numbers
editor.set_line_numbers_enabled(false);

// Or use builder pattern during initialization
let editor = CodeEditor::new("code", "rs")
    .with_line_numbers_enabled(false);

// Show line numbers (default behavior)
editor.set_line_numbers_enabled(true);

// Check current state
if editor.line_numbers_enabled() {
    println!("Line numbers are visible");
}
```

When disabled, the gutter is completely removed (0px width), providing more horizontal space for code display.

### Visible whitespace rendering

Whitespace rendering is **enabled by default**. Spaces are displayed as `·` and tab characters as `→` (with `·` fill to preserve alignment), both drawn in a dimmed color that blends with the active theme.

```rust
// Disable whitespace rendering
editor.set_show_whitespace(false);

// Re-enable it
editor.set_show_whitespace(true);

// Check current state
if editor.show_whitespace() {
    println!("Whitespace is visible");
}
```

The whitespace color is derived automatically from the active theme via `Style::whitespace_color` and can be overridden in a custom `Style`.

### Indentation guides

Indentation guides are **enabled by default**. A thin vertical line is drawn at every indentation level, making the nesting of a block visible without following its braces. Their spacing follows the configured `IndentStyle`, so switching from 4 spaces to 2 spaces (or to tabs) moves the guides accordingly.

```rust
// Disable indentation guides
editor.set_show_indent_guides(false);

// Or use builder pattern during initialization
let editor = CodeEditor::new("code", "rs")
    .with_show_indent_guides(false);

// Check current state
if editor.show_indent_guides() {
    println!("Indentation guides are visible");
}
```

Blank lines take the level of the surrounding block, so a blank line *inside* a block keeps its guides while a blank line *between* two blocks does not. Guides are not drawn on wrapped continuation segments, since those restart at the left edge of the code area. The guide color is derived automatically from the active theme via `Style::indent_guide_color` and can be overridden in a custom `Style`.

### Inline color previews

Inline color previews are **enabled by default**. Every color literal in the visible text gets a small square, filled with the color it denotes, drawn just after it — so a palette can be read at a glance instead of decoded by eye.

The recognized notations are:

| Notation | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| CSS hexadecimal | `#f0c`, `#f008`, `#1e1e2e`, `#ff000080` |
| Rust-style hexadecimal | `0x3A7BD5`, `0xFF6B6BCC` |
| Functional | `rgb(58, 123, 213)`, `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)`, `rgb(100%, 0%, 50%)` |

```rust
// Disable inline color previews
editor.set_show_color_previews(false);

// Or use builder pattern during initialization
let editor = CodeEditor::new("body { color: #f0c; }", "css")
    .with_show_color_previews(false);

// Check current state
if editor.show_color_previews() {
    println!("Color previews are visible");
}
```

Detection is purely lexical, so a literal inside a comment or a string gets a swatch too — which is what a reader looking for colors expects. Runs of hexadecimal digits of any other length are rejected (`#12345` is not a color), and a literal that continues an identifier (`raw0xff0000`) is ignored. The swatch is drawn as geometry and Iced renders all text above all geometry, so the character following the literal stays readable even when the square extends under it. Its frame uses `Style::gutter_border`, and translucent colors are composited over `Style::background`.

### Indentation

Auto-indentation is **enabled by default**: pressing Enter copies the leading whitespace of the current line to the new line. The indentation style (spaces or tab) is **4 spaces by default** and controls what is inserted when pressing Tab.

```rust
// Disable auto-indentation on Enter
editor.set_auto_indent_enabled(false);

// Check current state
if editor.auto_indent_enabled() {
    println!("Auto-indentation is active");
}
```

```rust
use iced_code_editor::IndentStyle;

// Use 2 spaces per indent level
editor.set_indent_style(IndentStyle::Spaces(2));

// Use tabs instead of spaces
editor.set_indent_style(IndentStyle::Tab);

// Restore the default (4 spaces)
editor.set_indent_style(IndentStyle::Spaces(4));

// Check current style
match editor.indent_style() {
    IndentStyle::Spaces(n) => println!("Indenting with {n} spaces"),
    IndentStyle::Tab => println!("Indenting with tabs"),
}
```

Available styles via `IndentStyle::ALL`: `Spaces(2)`, `Spaces(4)`, `Spaces(8)`, `Tab`.

### Auto-closing brackets/quotes

Auto-closing is **enabled by default**. Typing an opening bracket or quote (`(`, `[`, `{`, `"`, `'`) auto-inserts its matching closing character with the cursor placed between them; typing the closing character right after an already-inserted match moves the cursor past it instead of duplicating it; and typing an opening bracket/quote while text is selected wraps the selection in the pair instead of replacing it.

```rust
// Disable auto-closing of brackets/quotes
editor.set_auto_close_brackets(false);

// Check current state
if editor.auto_close_brackets() {
    println!("Auto-closing is active");
}
```

### Matching bracket/quote highlight

Matching bracket/quote highlight is **enabled by default**. Placing the cursor next to a bracket (`(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`) or a quote (`"`, `'`) highlights it and its matching pair.

```rust
// Disable the matching bracket/quote highlight
editor.set_bracket_match_highlight_enabled(false);

// Check current state
if editor.bracket_match_highlight_enabled() {
    println!("Matching bracket/quote highlight is active");
}
```

### Bracket-pair colorization

Bracket-pair colorization is **enabled by default**. Each `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}` is colored by its nesting depth, so a matching pair always shares the same color, cycling through a fixed palette (gold, orchid, light sky blue) as depth increases.

```rust
// Disable bracket-pair colorization
editor.set_bracket_pair_colorization_enabled(false);

// Check current state
if editor.bracket_pair_colorization_enabled() {
    println!("Bracket-pair colorization is active");
}
```

### Language Server Protocol (LSP)

LSP support provides hover documentation, auto-completion, and go-to-definition. It requires the `lsp-process` feature (not available on WASM):

```toml
[dependencies]
iced-code-editor = { version = "0.3", features = ["lsp-process"] }
```

#### Enable/disable LSP on an editor

```rust
// Enable LSP (attach a client and open the document)
editor.set_lsp_enabled(true);

// Disable LSP (detach the client)
editor.set_lsp_enabled(false);
```

#### Connecting an LSP server

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use iced_code_editor::{LspProcessClient, LspEvent, LspDocument};

// Create a channel to receive LSP events
let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel::<LspEvent>();

// Start the server (e.g., lua-language-server)
let client = LspProcessClient::new_with_server(
    "file:///path/to/project",
    tx,
    "lua-language-server",
)?;

// Attach the client to an editor with a document URI
editor.attach_lsp(
    Box::new(client),
    LspDocument::new("file:///path/to/file.lua", "lua"),
);
```

#### Rendering the overlay (hover + completion)

Use `LspOverlayState` to hold display state and `view_lsp_overlay` to render it:

```rust
use iced_code_editor::{LspOverlayState, LspOverlayMessage, view_lsp_overlay};

struct App {
    editor: CodeEditor,
    overlay: LspOverlayState,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
enum Message {
    LspOverlay(LspOverlayMessage),
    // ...
}

fn view(app: &App) -> Element<'_, Message> {
    // Stack the overlay on top of the editor
    stack![
        app.editor.view().map(Message::EditorEvent),
        view_lsp_overlay(
            &app.overlay,
            &app.editor,
            &app.theme,
            14.0,    // font size
            20.0,    // line height
            Message::LspOverlay,
        ),
    ].into()
}
```

Poll `LspEvent`s from the channel on each tick and update the overlay state:

```rust
// On LspEvent::Hover
overlay.show_hover(text);

// On LspEvent::Completion
overlay.set_completions(items, cursor_position);
```

#### Supported servers

Out of the box, the following servers are supported (the binary must be on `$PATH`):

| Server key                   | Language |
| ---------------------------- | -------- |
| `rust-analyzer`              | Rust     |
| `pyright`                    | Python   |
| `typescript-language-server` | JS / TS  |
| `lua-language-server`        | Lua      |
| `gopls`                      | Go       |

### Changing font

The default font of the editor is `iced::Font::MONOSPACE`. It can be changed with one of the default `iced` font or by loading a specific font:

```rust
let font = iced::font::Family::SansSerif;
editor.set_font(font);
```

> The editor support CJK font.

The default font size is **14px**. It can be changed:

```rust
editor.set_font_size(12.0, true);
```

## Themes

The editor natively supports all built-in Iced themes with automatic color adaptation.

Each theme automatically provides:

- Optimized background and foreground colors
- Adaptive gutter (line numbers) styling
- Appropriate text selection colors
- Themed cursor appearance
- Custom scrollbar styling
- Subtle current line highlighting

The editor intelligently adapts colors from the Iced theme palette for optimal code readability.
