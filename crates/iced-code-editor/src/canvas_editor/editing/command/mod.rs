//! Command pattern implementation for undo/redo functionality.
//!
//! This module provides a trait-based command system that allows all text
//! modifications to be recorded and reversed, enabling robust undo/redo support.
//!
//! Concrete commands are grouped by family into submodules: [`edit`] for
//! single-buffer editing, [`composite`] for grouping/replace commands,
//! [`lines`] for line-level moves/duplication, and [`comment`] for line-
//! comment toggling.
